# 2 : Results are returned as True or False. True --> Match & False --> Mismatch. The output should be DataFrame with 6 columns for comparison of 2 Dataframes.
        Column 1 --> Unique Key
        Column 2 --> Tuple : (Row Number in DF1, Row Number in DF2)
        Column 3 --> Tuple : (Column Name in DF1,Column Name in DF2)
        Column 4 --> Value of Mismatch in DF1
        Column 5 --> Value of Mismatch in DF2
        Column 6 --> Tolerance, (if column is date, Number, etc)
